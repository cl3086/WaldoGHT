# WaldoGHT
Final project for computer vision where we apply General Hough Transform to find Waldo.

We recommend using Python 3 to run this program.

```mkvirtualenv -p python3.7 virtualenv_name```

And then you can run the program using `python3 ght.py`.

As the image windows appear, you can close them by enter a key.
